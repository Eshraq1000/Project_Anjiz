The idea of ​​the application is to manage the team with high efficiency with the organization and coordination of work and assign tasks clearly among team members with the aim of achieving an agreed common result or goal.

The application workflow is hierarchical so that everyone on the team has a well-defined role, a clear set of responsibilities, the division of tasks has become more flexible, and the focus is on building a linear hierarchy based on collaboration and joint teamwork
